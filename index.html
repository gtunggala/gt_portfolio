            <p>
                Gabriel Tunggala is a student in Georgia Tech's Coding Boot Camp. She continues to try logging in 25
                hours of coding
                and studying for the course, but from time to time, enjoys pretending to be a sophisticated film buff
                and admits to
                spending too much time perfecting her playlists.
            </p>

            <p>
                When Gabriel is not talking about her two cats, cuddling her baby nephew, or acknowledging how
                predictable her life
                often is, she is an advocate for living a life well spent.
            </p>

            <p>
                Gabriel believes that the power of storytelling, along with creativity and technology are proponents of
                bettering
                humanity. She's passionate about work that seeks to provide sustainable solutions versus the one-time
                aid commonly
                provided- whether it be in education, poverty, or the workforce. Providing everyone access to clean
                water,
                abolishing human trafficking, and building healthy communities are just a few ideas that excite her. Her
                belief to
                see the world, not as it is, but as it could be has fortified the work ethics she brings and her
                eagerness to grow.
            </p>

            <p>
                She’s extremely introverted, but likes to make new friends, so don’t be afraid to say hello. If you'd
                really like to
                know her, mention that you like drinking matcha and ask why "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" is her
                favorite film.
